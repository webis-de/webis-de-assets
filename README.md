boilerplate code for new service templates.

Jekyll an all JavaScript dependencies on your system, run

    sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev build-essential node-npm
    sudo gem install jekyll
    npm install

After Jekyll and NPM are installed, you can `cd` into the main folder of this
repository and run

    jekyll serve
